# AGE CALCULATOR-


# The Age Calculator web application uses HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for responsive styling, and modern JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic functionality. JavaScript's Date object manages accurate age calculations, including leap years and varying month lengths. Event listeners and DOM manipulation ensure real-time updates as users enter their birthdate. The app is tested for cross-browser compatibility to deliver a consistent user experience across all devices.
